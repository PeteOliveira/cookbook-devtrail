## Features

* See the [TODO](docs/TODO.md) page for an idea of what's already being considered
* Suggest your own ideas / needs
* Prefer cloud support?  Suggest a cloud provider (preferably not Amazon, unless you want to provide me with a test account)

## Issues

* Open an issue if you have any problems using this in your weird environment (e.g. Windows)

## Pull Requests

* Squash commits
* I'll have tests soon, really.  You get to write tests for any features you add - that's how it works!
